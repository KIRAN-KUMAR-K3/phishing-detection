Project: AI-Based Phishing Detection System
ðŸš€ Objective: Develop an AI-powered phishing detection system that analyzes URLs and email content to determine whether they are phishing attempts.

ðŸ”¹ Features
URL Analysis: Uses machine learning to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate.
Email Content Analysis: Scans emails for phishing indicators like suspicious links, spelling errors, and urgent language.
Real-Time Detection: Can be integrated with a browser extension or email client.
Reporting System: Allows users to report phishing emails and improve model accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow
Data Collection: Phishtank API, OpenAI API for NLP
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Selenium
Database: MongoDB or SQLite
Frontend (Optional): React.js for a user interface
ðŸ”¹ Steps to Build
Step 1: Data Collection
Use datasets from PhishTank, OpenPhish, and Google Safe Browsing to get phishing URLs.
Scrape legitimate URLs from Alexa Top Sites for comparison.
Extract features like domain age, HTTPS presence, URL length, and keyword patterns.
Step 2: Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Convert URLs into numerical vectors (TF-IDF, One-hot encoding).
Extract text from email bodies and perform NLP processing (NLTK, Spacy).
Label data for training (1 = phishing, 0 = legitimate).
Step 3: Model Training
Train a classification model (Random Forest, SVM, Deep Learning).
Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimize with hyperparameter tuning.
Step 4: Deployment
Develop a Flask API for phishing detection requests.
Create a browser extension that sends URLs to the backend for real-time analysis.
Store user reports in a database for continuous learning.
Step 5: Testing & Security
Perform penetration testing to ensure no model poisoning attacks.
Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious activity.
ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
Train a deep learning model (BERT) for advanced phishing email detection.
Implement real-time notifications for suspicious emails.
Add a Threat Intelligence Dashboard for users to track phishing trends.
ðŸ’¡ Impact: Helps organizations and individuals detect phishing threats in real-time, reducing cyber attack risks.
